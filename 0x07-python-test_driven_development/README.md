# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

I was able to write and tests Python programs as part of this project.

Procedure followed to write tests:

-  I was able to test and it fail
-  I was able to write the program code
-  I now test the program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail
-  I now execute the correct tests
-  I now test the code
-  I now write more codes
-  I now write more tests

Test driven development has make me to learn from my mistakes while coding.
